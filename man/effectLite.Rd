effectLite(y, x, k = NULL, z = NULL, control = "0",
  measurement = character(), data, fixed.cell = FALSE, fixed.z = FALSE,
  missing = "listwise", se = "standard", bootstrap = 1000L,

}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Dependent variable (character string). Can be the name of a manifest variable or of a latent variable.}

\item{x}{Treatment variable (character string) treated as categorical variable.}

\item{k}{Vector of manifest variables treated as categorical covariates (character vector).}

\item{z}{Vector of continuous covariates (character vector). Names of both manifest and latent variables are allowed.}

\item{control}{Value of \code{x} that is used as control group.}

\item{measurement}{Measurement model. The measurement model is lavaan syntax (character string), that will be appended before the automatically generated lavaan input. It can be used to specify a measurement for a latent outcome variable and/or latent covariates. See also the example and \code{\link[EffectLiteR]{generateMeasurementModel}}.}

\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{fixed.cell}{logical. If \code{FALSE} (default), the group sizes are treated as stochastic rather than fixed.}

\item{fixed.z}{logical. If \code{FALSE} (default), the continuous covariates are treated as stochastic rather than fixed. fixed.z}

\item{missing}{Missing data handling. Will be passed on to \code{\link[lavaan]{sem}}.}

\item{se}{Type of standard errors. Will be 
passed on to \code{\link[lavaan]{sem}}.}

\item{bootstrap}{Number of bootstrap draws, if bootstrapping is used. Will be 
passed on to \code{\link[lavaan]{sem}}.}

\item{syntax.only}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, only syntax is returned and the model 
will not be estimated.}

\item{interactions}{character. Can be one of \code{c("all","none","2-way","X:K","X:Z")} and indicates the type of interaction used in the parameterization of the regression.}

\item{propscore}{Vector of covariates (character vector) that will be used to compute (multiple) propensity scores based on a multinomial regression without interactions. Alternatively, the user can specify a formula with the treatment variable as dependent variable for more control over the propensity score model.}

\item{ids}{Formula specifying cluster ID variables. Will be passed on to \code{\link[lavaan.survey]{lavaan.survey}}. See \code{\link[survey]{svydesign}} for details.}

\item{weights}{Formula to specify sampling weights. Currently only one weight variable is supported. Will be passed on to \code{\link[lavaan.survey]{lavaan.survey}}. See \code{\link[survey]{svydesign}} for details. Note: Only use weights if you know what you are doing. For example, some conditional treatment effects may require different weights than average effects.}

\item{homoscedasticity}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, residual variances of the dependent variable are assumed to be homogeneous across cells.}

\item{add}{Character string that will be pasted at the end of the generated lavaan syntax. Can for example be used to add additional (in-) equality constraints or to compute user-defined conditional effects.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{\link[lavaan]{sem}}. Currently not used.}

Object of class effectlite.

\description{
This function is the main funtion of the package and can be used to estimate
average and conditional effects of a treatment variable on an outcome variable,
taking into account any number of continuous and categorical covariates.
It automatically generates lavaan syntax for a multi-group structural equation
model, runs the model using lavaan, and extracts various average and conditional
effects of interest.

## Example with one categorical covariate
m1 <- effectLite(y="y", x="x", k="z", control="0", data=nonortho)
print(m1) 

## Example with one categorical and one continuous covariate
m1 <- effectLite(y="dv", x="x", k=c("k1"), z=c("z1"), control="control", data=example01)
print(m1)

## Example with latent outcome and latent covariate
measurement <- '
eta2 =~ 1*CPM12 + 1*CPM22
eta1 =~ 1*CPM11 + 1*CPM21
CPM11 + CPM12 ~ 0*1
CPM21 ~ c(m,m)*1
CPM22 ~ c(p,p)*1'
